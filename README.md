  I am now invested in the relation of **transposable elements** and the **birth and death of genes** in arachnids. TE domestication makes the floor for the birth of genes but also brings death to them when the insertion breaks the coding sequence. Does bursts in gene expansion correlate with higher ancient TE activity?
